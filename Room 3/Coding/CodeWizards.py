# Create a Simple LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache. Build a class called LRUCache that simulates a basic "Least Recently Used" caching system. The cache has a fixed maximum size. When the cache is full and a new item is added, the least recently used item should be removed. Implement get(key) and put(key, value) methods.

# Note: You can use OrderedDict or manage a custom doubly-linked list.
